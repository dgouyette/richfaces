            MethodExpression representing an tree node toggle listener method that will be notified when the tree node
            is selected. The expression must evaluate to a public method that takes an TreeSelectionChangeEvent
            parameter, with a return type of void, or to a public method that takes no arguments with a return type of
            void. In the latter case, the method has no way of easily knowing where the event came from, but this can
            be useful in cases where a notification is needed that "some action happened".
